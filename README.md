# Handsome Romeo (ReactJs & TailwindCSS)

### [Live demo](https://handsome-romeo.netlify.app/)

Handsome Romeo is an E-commerce website that shows luxurious man's clothes. Every product has its own page which contains information related to that product.
Users can add as many as products they want to the cart and increase the quantity of each product. However, they can not add a product that already exists in the WishList.
I have also tried to add user authentication using FireBase Authentication.
In addition, all data is saved in a JSON file inside /data folder.
